<h3>Binary tree</h3>
A binary tree is a tree where each node can have at most two children. 
So a node in binary tree can have only a left child, or a right child, or both or it can have no children which makes it a leaf node.

Binary tree data structure gives the best of both linked list and an ordered array. 
We can insert and delete nodes fast as in linked list and search a node fast as in an ordered array.

<h3>Binary Search tree</h3>
In Binary search tree 
For each node the node’s left child must have a value less than its parent node
              the node’s right child must have a value greater than or equal to its parent. 
If we consider the root node of the binary search tree the left subtree must have nodes with values less than the root node 
and the right subtree must have nodes with values greater than the root node.
