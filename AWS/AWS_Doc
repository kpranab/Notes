IAM (Identityand Access Management)
Your while AWS security is there :
 Users
 Groups
 Roles
Root account should never be used(and shared)
User must be created with proper permissions
IAM is at the center of AWS
Policies are written in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
IAM has a global view
Permissions are governed by Policies(JSON)
MFA(Multi Factor Authentication) can be setup
IAM has predefined "managed policies"
It's best to give users the minimal amount of permissions they need to perform their job(least privilege principles)
